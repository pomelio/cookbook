- the `/bin` folder is for containing the programs
- the `/docs` folder is for containing the private documents such as `json, md` files
- the `/public` folder is for containing the public documents such as `js, css, png, jpeg` files


## integration with github
The project environment needs to access program code and document resources, and these resources are stored on github, so the project needs to be integrated with github.
