# What the platform is
> The platform is a `Pages` running serverless environment. These pages are suited for web development.


Features:
- The platform includes user developed pages. These pages are developed by the `Wallaby language` to handle the http requests.
- These projects are hosted by the users' `github.com` repositories and being linked into the platform.
- Each project has its own independent domain name, and the https certificate is automatically installed. 
- Each project can be debugged online in a debugging server, which is able to intercept http requests, set breakpoints, single-step debugging, check variable values, etcs.
- After the development is completed, the repositories on github can be published to the production environment. The production is a serverless environment.
