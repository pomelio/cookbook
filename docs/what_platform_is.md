# What the platform is

- The platform is a program running environment. This environment can run programs developed by the `Wallaby language` to handle the http requests.
- Each project has its own independent domain name, and the https certificate is automatically installed. The project owner can link their own domain name to the project.
- Users create their own repositories on github, manage source code, and the platform can import repositories from GitHub.
- Each project can be debugged online, intercept http requests, set breakpoints, single-step debugging, check variable values
- After the development is completed, the repositories on github can be published to the production environment. The project is deployed into servers, but it is impossible to determine the specific server to handle the service.
